These memes were previously shared in another repository simply titled "woke", but that repository was predictably removed/censored (see screenshot below) without valid justification on Election Day 2024 (November 5) by pathetic woke cultists/crybullies/children who work for GitHub and were presumably having tantrums about the possibility of losing the election.

I suspect that the cult will eventually try to censor me again, so if my account or any of my repositories disappear then feel free to contact me at mwtheta@protonmail.com. I'll be happy to send you all of the files as well as make another GitHub account (or a few) and upload everything again so that they may be shared freely and continue infuriating the pitiful, delusional, humourless, authoritarian hall monitors who comprise the woke cult.
